This repository contains:

+ Some experiments in Python to solve the exercises of the class (that are required to be solved in Octave in the assignments) ;
+ My Latex notes summing up the vectorized implementation of the algorithms covered in class.

Note that this repository is not finished yet and is currently tracking my progress.

Note that this repository does not contain the solutions of the exercises in Octave since it is forbidden by the course's policy on Coursera.
