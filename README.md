This repository contains:

+ Some experiments in Python trying to solve the exact same exercises ;
+ My Latex notes summing up the vectorized implementation of the algorithms covered in class.

Note that this repository is not finished yet and is currently tracking my progress.

Note that this repository does not contain the solutions of the exercises in Octave since it is forbidden by the course's policy.
